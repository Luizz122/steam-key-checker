# TL;DR
Generate ==> Check ==(positive)==> Notify

# What is this?
This script allow you to create a random product key for [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), check if is valid and, in positive case, notify it to your bot on Telegram and print it on screen.

To create the API request, it need to access to your Steam account to retrieve the sessionID.

It can check 10 keys every 60 minuts. Yes, isn't fast. If you know how to speed up open an issue.

# What print ?

Print ```[ Error ] The product code you've entered is not valid. Please double check to see if you've mistyped your key. I, L, and 1 can look alike, as can V and Y, and 0 and O.``` if check the product key but it doesn't match.

Print ```[ Error ] There have been too many recent activation attempts from this account or Internet address. Please wait and try your product code again later.``` if you are in timeout time.



# How many games can i find ?
You have to be very very very lucky to find one.

The product key is composed by three series of five numbers - example A1B2C-3D4E5-F6G7H - and every position can be letter [A,Z] or number [0,9].

So, 35^15 possible combinations
ðŸ¤¯

# Why don't generate a list of all possible combinations and check it?
All combinations like this AAAA-AAAAA-XXXXX saved in .txt file, weigh 1GB.

So too much GB (or TB) to store.
